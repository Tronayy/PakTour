# PakTour
My first web development project.
I was going through a web development bootcamp course by Colt Steele on Udemy.
He created a web app called YelpCamp and deployed it on Heroku.
I followed a lot of his code and edited to form a similar personal web app and also deployed it on Heroku.
It's called PakTour, which initially includes places to visit in Pakistan, their description, some pictures and peoples reviews.
A cluster map was also included into it using MapBox.
New users can register and add places to visit and also give reviews on existing ones.
This repository contains the files being used other than the node modules.
