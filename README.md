# PakTour

My first web development project called 'PakTour'. This is an app that is meant to collect location information of the go-to spots in all of Pakistan.

Users can create new accounts, login, enter new locations into the database, enter descriptions and add images, and even add comments and reviews on each of the locations.

A cluster map was also included into it using MapBox. It shows the locations of the spots added on a map as cluster points.

This repository contains the files being used other than the node modules.

This is the URL to access the app: https://rocky-ravine-96287.herokuapp.com/
